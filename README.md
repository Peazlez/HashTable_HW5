First Draft (Image below):

Very poorly optimized, takes roughly 10-15 seconds for program to finish.  There are a lot of collisions as well, that will be where I first start to attempt to optimize.  
Also going to tie the for loops for empty space checking into one loop.  Going to add a timer as well for first optimization attempt.
